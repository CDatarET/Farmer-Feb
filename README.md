# Prime Potato Harvest

Farmer Feb has three fields with potatoes planted in them. He harvested `x` potatoes from the first field, `y` potatoes from the second field, and is yet to harvest potatoes from the third field.

Feb is very superstitious and believes that **if the total number of potatoes harvested from all three fields is a prime number**, he will make a huge profit.

Your task is to **help Farmer Feb determine the minimum number of potatoes he should harvest from the third field** (at least 1) so that the **total becomes a prime number**.

---

## Input

- The first line contains an integer `T` — the number of test cases.
- The next `T` lines each contain two integers `x` and `y`, separated by a space.

---

## Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the minimum number of potatoes to be harvested from the third field such that the total number of potatoes is a prime number.

---

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ T ≤ 1000`
- `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000`
- At least 1 potato must be harvested from the third field
